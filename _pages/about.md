Hi, my name is Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu. I am actively seeking PhD opportunites starting from 2025 Fall. 

Previously, I was a machine learning researcher at [Celeris Therapeutics](https://celeristx.com/) working on [PROTACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteolysis_targeting_chimera) related drug discovery projects. I obtained my M.S. degree (with high distinction) from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) advised by [Daniel Cremers](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/members/cremers) where I worked on uncertainty estimation on geometric deep learning and B.S. degree from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
